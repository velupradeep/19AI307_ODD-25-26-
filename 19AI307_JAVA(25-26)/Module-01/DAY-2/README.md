# Ex.No:1(B) CONDITIONAL STATEMENT

## QUESTION:
A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first 5 days the fine is 50 paise, for 6-10 days fine is one rupee and above 10 days fine is 5 rupees. If you return the book after 30 days your membership will be cancelled - Print ("Your Membership would be Cancelled.")

Write a program to accept the number of days the member is late to return the book and display the fine or the appropriate message


## AIM:
To implement a program using conditional statements


## ALGORITHM :
1. Read the number of overdue days from the user.
2. If days ≤ 5, calculate fine as days × 0.5.
3. Else if days > 5 and ≤ 10, calculate fine as days × 1.
4. Else if days > 10 and < 30, calculate fine as days × 5.
5. If days > 30, calculate fine as days × 5 and also display that the membership is cancelled.
